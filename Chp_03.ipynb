However, as we increase our sample size (let's say 1000 tosses), our model updates towards a parameter that more accurately represents the true ratio between water-to-land, which is roughly $0.71$ (i.e. our index finger will land on water in approximately 710 of those tosses).\n",

The main job of the **compatibility interval** is to communicate the shape of the distribution.
