        "In the U.S., there's a misleading correlation between the number of waffle houses in a given state and the likelihood of divorces in that states with a higher concentration of waffle houses also have the highest divorce rates. As far as we know there isn't a plausible mechanism explaining why waffle houses cause high divorce rates, but it does make us wonder whether there are other forces at play which explain the high divorce rates and have some connection to the frequency of waffle houses.\n",
        "\n",
        "In large datasets, it's not surprising to find correlations or relationships between variables we wouldn't intuitively think have any connection to one another. However, since most correlations don't necessarily equate to causal relationships with one another, we need tools such as **multiple regression** models to distinguish between these associations.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the name suggests, **multiple regression** is similar to linear regression in the sense that we're using a predictor variable to simulate an outcome we're interested in \\(i.e. our target variable\\), except that we're using various predictor variables to achieve this rather than just the one variable we're used to. Multiple Regression models are essential for the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The multiple linear regression model helps us understand and predict a target variable by \"controlling\" for *confounding variables*, which are things which may mislead us into inferring a causal relationship between two or more variables. For example in the U.S., the states that have the highest concentration of waffle houses are in the southern United States so we may begin to associate Southern States with high likelihoods of divorce.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. It's also important to account for the high likelihood that our target variable may be the product of a complex relationship between various predictor variables. For example, the effects of one predictor variable may cloud the effects of other predictor variables. With **multiple regression models**, we'll have the ability to *measure the effects of each of the predictor variables on the target variable separately and simultaneously* which therefore increases our understanding of the factors influencing the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In addition to understanding their separate effects, multiple regression models can help us understand the *interaction* between predictor variables. For example, having access to high-quality food and water each has a separate effect on the peak height of an individual wolf in comparison to other wolves. However, a wolf won't get very far if it doesn't have access to one or the other which is why it's important to understand how a certain predictor variable influences the target variable within the context of other predictors."

In complex dynamical systems, everything seems to cause everything which therefore causes \"cause\" to lose its value. While there are many disagreements across the board on causal inference, there's one thing many people agree on: That is, *causal inference always depends on unverifiable assumptions.* In other words, it's always possible to spot scenarios where your inference about the cause is mistaken, no matter how careful you are about the design or analysis.

As we can see from the graph, there seems to be a positive relationship between marriage rate and divorce where the higher the marriage rate per 1000 adults for a given rate, the higher the divorce rate seems to be as well. However, the question we have to ask ourselves is whether the marriage rate *causes* divorce? Well in some sense it does because one cannot get a divorce if they weren't married in the first place. However, if, for example, a population places a high cultural value on marriage to begin with, an assumption we could make is that adults want to live long and happy lives in their marriage which should therefore result in *lower* divorce rates. So why is there a positive correlation between the two?\n",

Unfortunately, modelling merely quantifies uncertainty in the precise way that the model understands the problem. Answers to large world problems about \"truth\" and \"causation\" often depend on information not included in the model. For example, any observed correlation between a target and a predictor variable could be either eliminated or reversed when another predictor is added to the model. But if we cannot think of the right variable, we might never notice. Therefore, all statistical models are vulnerable, regardless of the precision of their estimates and the apparent accuracy of their predictions. Rounds of model criticism and revision embody the real tests of scientific hypotheses. A true hypothesis will pass and fail many statistical \"tests\" on its way to acceptance."

Because `x_real` and `x_spur` seem to have a relationship with `y` where the data seems to drift to the top right as we move along the x-axis, we can infer that they are both at least correlated to `y`. However, if we were to build a linear regression that predicts `y` using both `x_` variables, we'll find that the posterior mean (otherwise what we also like to call the \"weight\") for the association between `y` and `x_spur` will be close zero just like what we saw when exploring the relationship between divorce rate and marriage rate."

        "- In the case of linear regression, there's no way to know which independent predictor variable \\(median age and marriage rate\\) is best at predicting the dependent target variable \\(divorce rate\\) by doing separate linear regressions.\n",
        "- Instead, we need to make causal assumptions about our data. For example, does age directly affect divorce ($ A → D$)? Or perhaps age indirectly affects it by influencing the marriage rate ($ A → M → D$)?  Alternatively, is it possible that the marriage rate may also be influencing the divorce rate through age ($M → A → D $)?\n",
        "- **Multiple Linear Regression** helps us solve this question by helping us understand whether there's additional value in knowing another variable from the predictor variables that we already know. For example, if we condition on one variable, in this case, $A$, we can see whether it accurately predicts our target variable, $D$, independently of $M$. After fitting our Multiple Regression model to predict divorce rates, we're therefore better suited to answer the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "> 1. After I already know the marriage rate of a given state, what additional value is there in also knowing the median age of marriage?\n",
        ">\n",
        "> 2. After I already know the median age of marriage for a given state, what additional value is there in also knowing the marriage rate?\n",
        "\n",
        "- From the forest plot in Code `5.11`, we can clearly see that when comparing the marriage rate parameter on our Multiple Linear Regression model `m5_3` against the Simple Linear Regression model `m5_2`, the $\\beta_M$ parameter significantly fell much closer to $0$ when the median age $\\beta_A$ parameter was included in the model. This implies that there isn't much value in using the marriage rate $M$ to predict divorce rates $D$ if we have information on the median age of marriage $A$ parameter.\n",
        "- Therefore the DAG on the right that we built in Section 5.1.2 is likely the more accurate one between the two.\n",
        "- One of the downsides of utilizing Multi-Linear Regression models is that it's slightly more challenging to interpret how the IVs impact the DV. Luckily for us, we have three tools at our disposal that may help us better understand these relationships in our model:\n",
        "\n",
        "> 1. Predictor residual plots / **Residual sum of squares ($R^2$)**: While the slope value of each independent variable helps us understand how they individually swing the model's prediction of the dependent variable, so too can each predictor's **residual sum of squares \\($R^2$\\)** help us capture this information by calculating the amount of variance that each predictor accounts for in its prediction. As a reminder, a perfect $R^2$ score of $1$ indicates that the model perfectly captured all the variance in the model but this may also be a sign of the model overfitting. In addition to calculating the $R^2$ for each predictor, it's also useful to plot each data point's residual against the target variable like we did in the bottom row of `Figure 5.4` to visually inspect each predictor's preformance against the target. For additional reference, here is the formula to calculate the residual sum of squares: $ R^2 = \\frac{SS_{resid}}{SS_{total}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2} $\n",
        ">\n",
        "> 2. Another technique we can utilize is to generate a **posterior predictive plot** like we did in `Figure 5.5` which plots our predicted values against the actual values to see how close they are to a regression line which represents the instances where our prediction exactly matches the actual value.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> 3. The last technique we can deploy is to build a **counterfactual plot** which is almost like a stress test of a model by using simulated data to inform a specific parameter and then observing how the model reacts. For example, if we use completely new, simulated data to inform the marriage rate prior and model its relationship with the divorce rate ($M → D$) like we did in `Figure 5.7`, we would still end up with a relatively flat relationship indicating that marriage rate doesn't do as much to help us predict the divorce rate for a given state.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If we want to include categorical variables in our analysis, the best thing to do is to apply an **index variable** to each class within the categorical variable. For example, if we have `sex` as a predictor variable, we can assign the following indexes to each class: $male = 1$ & $female = 2$. The same rules would apply even if we had multiple classes within our categorical variable. By assigning an index variable, we could even differentiate how the prior and posterior distributions change for each class. However, the mathematical notation for the linear model would change slightly to a format similar to the following:\n",
