        "\n",
        "We start with the famous story of Mikołaj Kopernik (Copernicus), who argued for a **heliocentric (Sun-centered)** model to replace the old geocentric (Earth-centered) model. This is often framed as science triumphing over ideology, but Kopernik’s original justification was surprisingly weak. *His model was neither more accurate nor particularly harmonious* because he still assumed perfect circular orbits and his model required complex extra circles, called epicycles, just like the old Ptolemaic model. In fact, his model made exactly the same predictions as the old one.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, Kopernik did appeal to a different principle: *simplicity*. He argued his model was superior because it achieved the same result using fewer causes and required fewer epicycles than its competitor. This preference for simpler theories often relies on **Ockham's Razor** which is a principle stating that models with fewer assumptions should be preferred. In the case of Kopernik and Ptolemy, Ockham's razor offered a clear resolution since their predictions were identical.\n",
        "\n",
        "The difficulty is that, usually, we have to choose among models that differ in both **accuracy** and **simplicity**. Ockham's razor doesn't tell us how to trade those criteria off against one another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of Ockham's razor, we should think of **Ulysses' compass** to navigate this trade-off. We must navigate between two fundamental types of statistical error:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Overfitting**: Like the many-headed beast, Scylla, this monster leads to poor prediction because the model learns too much from the specific quirks of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Underfitting**: Like the whirpool sea monster, Charybdis, who pulled boats and men to their watery grave, underfitting leads to poor prediction because the model learns too little from the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is also a third issue: **confounding**. A confounded model that incorrectly measures causes can *sometimes produce better predictions than a model that correctly measures a causal relationship*.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Since different models are needed for each task, this forces us to decide whether our goal is to *understand causes* or merely to *make predictions*.\n",
        "\n",
        "No matter the goal, we must deal with the overfitting and underfitting monsters. There are two main ways to carefully navigate this challenge:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Using a **regularizing prior** (also known as **penalized likelihood**) which \"dumbs down the model\" to prevent it from getting overexcited by the data. There's usually two penalties we can pick from:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * The **L1 Penalty** which is similar to feature selection which will reduce certain features down to 0;\n",
        "    * The **L2 Penalty** which lowers the value of all the features uniformly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Using a scoring device like **information criteria** or **cross-validation** to explicitly estimate a model's predictive accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both approaches are commonly used and should often be used in combination. To introduce **information criteria** (like AIC, DIC, WAIC, and PSIS-LOO), we first have to cover information theory, which might seem strange at first. The irony is that while using these criteria is easy, truly understanding their conceptual foundations is much harder and normally takes more time to comprehend."

        "\n",
        "The most common way many scientists currently choose a model is by searching for one where every predictor's coefficient is **statistically significant**. This practice, sometimes called \"stargazing\" because it involves looking for asterisks (**) next to estimates, assumes the model full of stars is the best.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this method is fundamentally flawed. Regardless of your general opinion on null hypothesis significance testing, using p-values to select between models with different structures is a mistake. P-values are not designed to help you navigate the crucial trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. You will find that predictor variables which significantly improve a model's predictive power are not always statistically significant. Conversely, a variable might be statistically significant but offer no useful contribution to prediction. Since the conventional 5% significance threshold is arbitrary, it cannot be expected to optimize the balance between simplicity and accuracy."

        "In previous chapters, we learned that adding variables can both help (by revealing hidden effects) and hurt (by causing collider bias when the causal model is flawed). However, what if we want to abandon the goal of causal inference because our interest was only on predictive accuracy? In the grandparent-parent-child example, simply adding all variables improved the model's predictive accuracy, regardless of whether we understand the underlying causes. The question then becomes: is \"just adding everything\" ever okay? The answer is no, due to two related problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first problem is that adding more parameters, thus making the model more complex, almost always improves the model's fit to the sample data used to train it. Measures like $R^2$, which are designed to quantify that amount of variance that a model can explain, increases as you add more predictor variables, even if they were just random noise. Therefore, choosing a model based solely on how well it fits the existing data is unreliable. $R^2$ is calculated using the following formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ R^2 = \\frac{SS_\\text{Resid} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y - \\hat{y})^2}{SS_\\text{Total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y - \\bar{y})^2}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, while complex models fit the existing data well, they often make worse predictions on new data. Models with many parameters tend to **overfit**, meaning they become too sensitive to the specific training sample and make large errors on future data. On the other hand, simple models with too few parameters tend to **underfit**, systematically mispredicting the outcome regardless of how closely future data resembles the past. Since we can't always favor the simplest or the most complex model, we must seek a balance between them.\n",

        "It's possible to use the standard non-Bayesian method of **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**, also known as a standard (non-Bayesian) simple linear regression model, to get the results for these brain size models. While OLS won't give you a posterior for the uncertainty ($\\sigma$), as long as we use vague priors, the OLS procedure, which minimizes the distance between the data points and the regression line, is equivalent to finding the posterior mean in a Bayesian model. Interestingly, Carl Friedrich Gauss actually derived OLS using a Bayesian framework originally. The main takeaway is that nearly every non-Bayesian statistical method has an approximate Bayesian interpretation. This fact is powerful because understanding a non-Bayesian method in terms of its Bayesian assumptions can help you understand why it works. Conversely, a complex Bayesian model can often be run more quickly using a simpler, approximate non-Bayesian method. Ultimately, Bayesian inference just means finding the posterior distribution; it doesn't specify which particular mathematical tool you must use to find it.\n",

        "The goal of this discussion isn't to praise the $R^2$ measure, but to show its limitations before we move on to better tools. To calculate $R^2$, which measures how well our model fits the data we used to build it, we first need to figure out the model's predictions for each data point. We then subtract the actual observation from its prediction to get the residual. Next, we need to calculate the variance for both the residuals and the original outcome variable. Here's a [recap](#scrollTo=zLNCKKKefq7f) of the actual $R^2$ formula that we provided earlier. I caution you to use the exact *empirical variance*, which is the average squared deviation from the mean, instead of the standard function, which uses a frequentist estimator. Although a fully Bayesian approach would technically require calculating this for every sample from the posterior, we'll follow tradition here and just compute $R^2$ using the average (mean) prediction:\n",

While not perfectly identical concepts, they address the exact same problem: **Bias** is related to the problem of **underfitting**, and **variance** is related to **overfitting**. However, these terms can be confusing because they are used inconsistently across different areas of statistics . Furthermore, the word \"bias\" sounds inherently bad, even though **increasing bias** (simplifying the model) often leads to *better predictions* for new data. Because of this potential for confusion, we prefer the clearer terms of **underfitting** and **overfitting**, though you should expect to encounter the bias-variance trade-off used to describe these issues elsewhere."

If we had all the relevant information about a system (say, the exact physics of a coin toss), the outcome would be completely deterministic and the \"true\" probabilities would just be 0 (impossible) or 1 (certain). However, since we always lack some relevant information, all outcomes in our simplified model become uncertain, leading us to use \"true\" probabilities that fall somewhere between zero and one.\n",

Based on our simple model, there is a \"true\" probability of hitting water.

        "While the log-probability score provides a mathematically principled way to measure a model's distance from the truth, the version we have calculated so far suffers from the exact same flaw as $R^2$. It consistently improves as the model becomes more complex, regardless of whether that complexity is actually helpful for understanding the underlying phenomenon. This happens because log-probability calculated on the training data is strictly a measure of **retrodictive accuracy** which is how well the model can \"predict\" the data it has already seen—rather than **predictive accuracy**, which is how well it will perform on new, unseen data. Just as adding parameters allows $R^2$ to climb toward perfection by chasing noise, it also allows the log-probability score to increase, creating a false sense of security about the model's quality. To truly understand a model's value, we must look beyond its ability to describe the past and find ways to estimate how it will handle the future.\n",

This serves as a stark reminder that we simply cannot judge models based solely on their performance with training data; to do so is to invite the disaster of overfitting. What truly matters is how a model performs on new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To bring this challenge into focus, we can use a thought experiment to simulate scores both in and out of sample. Imagine we have a training sample of size $N$ which we use to estimate our model's parameters and calculate a training score of $D_{train}$. Then, imagine a second \"test\" sample of the same size $N$ generated by the exact same process. By using the model we built from the first sample to predict the outcomes of the second, we can calculate a test score,  $D_{test}$. This procedure allows us to precisely measure the gap between retrodictive accuracy, which is how well we describe the past, and predictive accuracy which is how well we navigate the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "To visualize how accuracy behaves, we can conduct a thought experiment 10,000 times using five different linear regression models. In this simulation, the \"truth\" is generated by a model with only two predictors where we fit models ranging from one to five parameters to see how they perform. By calculating the deviance, we can track how well these models fit the data they were trained on ($D_{train}$) as compared to how well they predict entirely new samples ($D_{test}$).\n",

        "The results in [Figure 7.6](#scrollTo=erHh2F4f-dXh) reveal a consistent pattern: As we add parameters, the training deviance always improves (gets smaller), mirroring the behavior of $R^2$. However, the out-of-sample deviance tells a different story. In a small sample of $ N = 20 $, the out-of-sample deviance is minimized at three parameters, which is the \"true\" model, then begins to get worse as additional parameters start fitting pure noise. Interestingly, with very little data, a simpler \"false\" model can sometimes out-predict a more complex \"true\" model because the simpler model avoids the high error caused by imprecise parameter estimates. As the sample size increases to $ N = 100 $, the models become better at identifying the true relationships, and the gap between training and test performance narrows.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most important takeaway is that deviance is an assessment of **predictive accuracy**, not a direct measure of \"truth.\" A model containing the correct variables isn't guaranteed to give the best predictions if the data is too sparse to estimate those variables accurately. These simulations demonstrate that while adding variables always makes a model look better on the data at hand, its performance on future data depends on a delicate balance between the complexity of the underlying process and the amount of evidence available. This tension forms the theoretical foundation for using both regularizing priors and information criteria to choose better models."

        "What if I told you that one way to produce better predictions is to intentionally make the model worse at fitting your current sample? It sounds counterintuitive but it is actually a powerful truth of statistical modeling. The root of **overfitting** is a model’s tendency to get overexcited by the training sample. However, when we use flat or nearly flat priors, we are telling the machine that every possible parameter value is equally plausible. This encourages the model to return a posterior that chases every tiny fluctuation in the data, effectively memorizing the noise as if it were a signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "To prevent this overexcitement, we can use a \"skeptical\" or **regularizing prior** which essentially slows the model's rate of learning from the sample by favoring values closer to zero or a central mean. When tuned properly, a regularizing prior reduces overfitting while still allowing the model to capture the truly regular features of the data. Of course, if the prior is too skeptical, the model might ignore important patterns and result in underfitting, so the challenge becomes one of finding the right balance. However, as you will see, even a small amount of skepticism can help a model perform significantly better in the \"large world,\" where no model or prior is ever truly perfect.\n",

On [Figure 7.7](#scrollTo=70hpIzTRNmmC), this prior is represented in the *dashed line* and what it tells us is that the model that it is highly skeptical of extreme values before seeing any data, thus assigning very little plausibility to any effect larger than two standard deviations. By concentrating probability mass around zero, these priors act as a conservative force, shrinking our parameter estimates toward zero and preventing the model from overreacting to every spike and dip in the training data.\n",

        "The other lines in Figure 7.7 represent more conservative priors. The thin solid curve is a stronger Gaussian prior with a standard deviation of $0.5$ while the thick solid curve is an even stronger prior with a deviation of $0.2$."

In [Figure 7.8](#scrollTo=2M3FLVxVNy5Q), we'll repeat the train-test example we used in [Figure 7.6](#scrollTo=erHh2F4f-dXh), along with the three regularized priors in Figure 7.7, to show that in small samples, a tight prior intentionally makes the training deviance worse because it prevents the model from adapting perfectly to that specific sample. To further contextualize, the blue lines display the results for the training data while the black line represents the deviance in the test data. The different line styles show the results for the three regularizing priors we're testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we look at the left-hand plot where $N = 20$, we'll notice that the defviance always increases (i.e. the predictive accuracy gets worse) as the priors get tighter. However, this is a trade-off worth making because as we see with the test data - the out-of-sample deviance actually improves, especially in overly complex models. By using a very skeptical prior, we can essentially \"neutralize\" the harm of adding too many parameters, as the prior prevents the model from chasing the noise those extra variables provide.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the sample size increases to $N = 100$ in the right-hand plot, the influence of these priors naturally fades because the overwhelming evidence in the data eventually overpowers our initial skepticisml, regardless of how tight our priors were initially. This demonstrates the beauty of regularizing priors which is that they provide essential protection when data is scarce without permanently blinding the model to strong patterns when data is abundant. However if they are too skeptical, they prevent the model from learning from that data. Ultimately, the goal is to find the right level of skepticism to reduce overfitting without causing underfitting, a balance that leads directly to the more advanced \"adaptive\" regularization we see in multilevel models."

In this framework, the narrowness of the prior is controlled by a precision parameter, $\\lambda$. Just like the Bayesian approach, choosing a $\\lambda > 0$ serves to reduce overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. However, the risk remains that if $\\lambda$ is set too high, the model may become overly biased and result in underfitting.\n",

Instead of calculating a full posterior distribution, it employs a modified version of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) that incorporates $\\lambda$ directly into the matrix algebra used to estimate parameters. Although tools like the `lm.ridge` function make this regularization easy to implement, it is a curious fact of history that most traditional statistical methods continue to operate without any regularization at all, leaving them vulnerable to the \"excitement\" of the training sample."

This is known as **cross-validation** where we leave out a small chunk of observations, train the model on the rest, and then evaluate how well it predicts those \"missing\" pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we don't want to waste data, we typically divide the sample into several chunks called \"folds,\" asking the model to predict each fold after training on all the others, and then averaging the scores. While the minimum number of folds you can test on is $2$, an extremely common process is called **leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)** which uses the maximum possible number where *each individual observation becomes its own fold*.\n",

        "However, the primary trouble with LOOCV is that if you have 1000 observations, you theoretically have to compute 1000 separate posterior distributions, which is incredibly time-consuming and compute intensive. Luckily there's a clever shortcut called **Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS)** which estimates the importance of each observation. By \"importance,\" what we mean here is that some data points have a much larger impact on the posterior than others and we can observe this by observing how much it affects the poster if it were to be removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key intuition here is that an observation that is relatively unlikely, and therefore may violate our model's expectations, is more \"important\" because it changes our expectation and thus results in an updated posterior belief. We can characterize the \"importance\" of these observations as **weights** which can be used to estimate our model's out-of-sample accruacy. Additionally, these weights can approximate the cross-validation score without ever actually refitting the model.\n",

        "\n",
        "Perhaps the best feature of PSIS is that it is \"self-aware\" by providing feedback about its own reliability through flagging specific observations with very high weights that might make the PSIS score inaccurate. This allows us to gain the benefits of cross-validation with a fraction of the computational cost while remaining alert to potential errors in the estimate."

If we have $N$ observations, we fit the model $N$ times, each time dropping a single observation $y_i$. The total out-of-sample **log-pointwise-predictive-density ($\\text{lppd}_{cv}$)** is then calculated by summing the log-average accuracy of each omitted observation, using only the posterior distributions that were trained without that specific point. Mathematically, the cross-validation score is expressed as:\n",

Instead of refitting the model every time we drop an observation, we can take samples from the \"full\" posterior (the one trained on all the data), $p ( y_i | \\Theta_s )$, and adjust them so they look like samples from a \"leave-one-out\" posterior. To do this, we calculate the \"importance\" of each sample $s$ for a given omitted observation $y_i$.The trick relies on an **importance weight**, $r(\\Theta_s)$, which is defined as the inverse of the probability of the omitted observation:\n",

However, the most valuable part of this process is arguably that it provides an internal diagnostic tool via shape parameter, $k$, which provides information about the reliability of the approximation. Each data point gets its own $k$ value, which acts as a measure of that point's influence. If $k > 0.5$, the variance becomes infinite, indicating a \"thick tail\" that makes the weights harder to trust. Still, research suggests that PSIS' weights preform well as long as $k$ stays below $0.7$. When we use this method in practice, these $k$ values serve as essential warnings that flag influential observations that might be distorting our model's world view."

        "\n",
        "This is one of the most remarkable results in machine learning because it suggests that the \"overfitting penalty\" is directly proportional to a model's complexity. This phenomenon is the foundation of the **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**, which estimates the average out-of-sample deviance using a deceptively simple formula:\n",

        "\n",
        "Because flat priors are hardly ever the best priors, we need more flexible tools that are generalizable. While the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) was a step toward handling informative priors, we will focus on the **Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC)** which is far more powerful because it makes no assumptions about the shape of the posterior distribution. It provides an approximation of out-of-sample deviance by aiming for the out-of-sample K-L Divergence directly.\n",

        "Unfortunately, computing the WAIC comes at the expense of a more complicated formula. However, we can think of it as a <u>method for model selection</u> to select the model with the best ability to generalize and predict unseen data by balancing the model's complexity with it's preformance on the training data (**[lppd](#scrollTo=uvfO2y01kwiH)**). A simplified version of the WAIC formula below is: `WAIC = -2 * (Fit - Complexity)`.\n",

        "\n",
        "Historically, this penalty is often called the \"effective number of parameters\" ($p_{WAIC}$), but that label can be misleading. In modern modeling, especially multilevel models, the relationship between parameters is what matters most so therefore adding a parameter can sometimes actually *reduce* the \"**effective number of parameters**\" (a term that is sometimes used interchangeably with WAIC). We can also call it the total overfitting risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because WAIC is \"pointwise,\" meaning that predictions are considered 'case-by-case' or 'point-by-point' in the data, it offers several practical advantages. First, it acknowledges that some observations are simply harder to predict or involve more uncertainty than others. Second, because it handles the data as a collection of independent points, we can use the central limit theorem to calculate a standard error for our WAIC estimate for each observation:\n",

        "However, this pointwise nature also reveals a limitation about WAIC in that it assumes that observations are independent and \"exchangeable\" with one another.

In statistical terms, these criteria are not **consistent**, meaning they aren't designed to identify the exact structure of reality. However, this doesn't mean they are broken; it simply means their target is different. Their goal is to nominate the model that will produce the best possible predictions, and in the messy world of science, being \"true\" and being \"predictive\" are not always the same thing.\n",

        "Concerns about consistency are usually based on **asymptotic** logic where we imagine what happens as our sample size  approaches infinity.

        "\n",
        "However with infinite data, an overly complex model is harmless to the model's predictive accuracy because every parameter can be precisely estimated with this much data. If you have enough data to estimate every parameter with perfect precision, the likelihood becomes so sharp that the posterior distribution for every parameter (even the \"extra\" ones) collapses around its true value. If the \"true\" effect of a variable is zero, a model with infinite data will estimate that coefficient as exactly zero with zero uncertainty. Additionally, the complex model essentially \"simplifies itself\" at the limit and its predictions become identical to the simpler, true model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the real world and especially with the natural and social sciences, the models we consider are almost never the actual data-generating processes anyway. Since we are usually choosing between different approximations of a complex reality, it makes little sense to obsess over identifying a \"true\" model that doesn't exist in our set. Instead, we should focus on what these criteria are actually good at which is finding the model that best balances complexity and evidence to navigate the future."

However, the choice between them isn't actually about whether you are a \"Bayesian\" or not. In fact, both can be motivated through either Bayesian or non-Bayesian logic. The BIC is closely related to the **Bayes factor** which compares models by looking at their \"average likelihood\" of a linear model which describes the likelihood of the data averaged over the entire prior distribution (i.e. the denomenator in Bayes' Theorem). Because this average likelihood naturally penalizes models that spread their prior probability too thinly over many parameters, it provides a built-in defense against overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, many Bayesian practitioners are wary of Bayes' factors for two major reasons. First, the average likelihood is notoriously difficult to calculate. Even if you have a perfect posterior distribution, the math required to find the denominator of Bayes’ theorem can be a nightmare and you may not be able to estimate the average likelihood. Second, Bayes factors are incredibly sensitive to the choice of priors. Even \"weak\" priors that have no visible effect on a single model’s results can radically shift the comparison between two different models.\n",

The most important thing to remember is that both are purely predictive tools. They are designed to find patterns that help forecast the future but they are entirely blind to causation. They will happily nominate a model full of confounded variables if those variables happen to improve its \"score,\" reminding us that a good prediction is not the same thing as a true explanation.\n"

        "With definitions of cross-validation, PSIS, and WAIC in hand, we can now visualize how these criteria actually perform in guessing the future. The goal of any such criterion is to estimate **Out-of-Sample Deviance** (often called **Test Deviance**), which is the \"**Average Error**\" a model would make when predicting data it hasn't seen before. By comparing this to the **In-Sample Deviance** (the model's error on the data it was trained on), we can see the \"overfitting gap.\" [Figure 7.9](#scrollTo=DUF-cNfVUnVy) illustrates this across 1,000 simulations, testing how well our mathematical shortcuts can predict that gap.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the top-left plot (where the sample size $N = 20$), we see a clear distinction between models using flat priors (the open points) and those using regularizing priors (the filled points). The regularizing priors consistently result in lower out-of-sample deviance, meaning they are better at predicting new data. Our main interest, however, is in the trend lines representing *WAIC (black), full cross-validation (solid blue), and PSIS (dashed blue).*\n",
        "\n",
        "All three criteria do a remarkably good job of tracking the actual average out-of-sample scores. This confirms a vital truth: Provided the process generating the data remains the same, it is truly possible to use a single sample to accurately guess the accuracy of our future predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "While these criteria get the \"average\" right over many simulations, we must also consider how much they miss the mark in any single, specific sample. The upper-right plot shows this \"**Average Error**\" which is the absolute difference between the estimated deviance and the true out-of-sample deviance. In these small samples, WAIC is slightly more accurate on average. This makes sense because WAIC is specifically designed to guess the out-of-sample **Kullback–Leibler (K-L) Divergence**, whereas cross-validation is a \"trick\" that only perfectly converges to that target as the sample size grows. When we move to the bottom row ($N = 100$), the differences vanish and with enough data, all three criteria become effectively identical.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of these simple linear models, PSIS and WAIC perform very similarly. While WAIC is technically a more precise estimator of the K-L Divergence, the practical difference is often smaller than the overall expected error. If our only goal is to rank models from best to worst, both criteria are equally capable. However, PSIS offers a distinct advantage: it provides the $k$ values as a warning system. These diagnostics tell us exactly when the approximation might be failing and which specific data points are causing the trouble. In the end, we don't just want a score; we want to know when we can trust that score."

This is a helpful starting point, but it doesn't mean these tools are restricted to those specific conditions. We don't need the \"true\" data-generating model to be among our candidates for these criteria to be useful; we only need to compare the relative distances between models to identify which one predicts better. However, it is important to realize that this \"train-test\" thought experiment is just one way to evaluate a model, and it isn't always representative of the real-world tasks we face.\n",
        "\n",
        "A much larger concern is the \"uniformitarian\" assumption which is the belief that future data will come from the exact same process and range of values as our past data. If this assumption fails, our information criteria cannot save us. Imagine fitting a model to the relationship between height and weight in a town within a 3rd world country where everyone is quite thin. If you then try to use that model to predict the heights of people in a much wealthier, heavier town in a 1st world country, your model will fail spectacularly.

No automated statistical procedure can solve this problem for you. Overcoming these limitations requires repeated rounds of model fitting, prediction, and—most importantly—rigorous scientific criticism. Ultimately, statistics is a powerful tool for navigating the data we have, but it is no substitute for a deep, scientific understanding of the process we are trying to study.\n"

        "We have reached a critical point in our journey. When faced with several plausible models, we know that simply following the \"best fit\" to our current data is a trap as it will always lead us toward overly complex models that fail in the future. We’ve established that information divergence is our true North Star for accuracy, but even that requires us to look at data the model hasn't seen yet. To solve this, we’ve developed two complementary strategies:\n",

Actually using these tools in code is deceptively easy, which makes them dangerous if you don't understand what they are doing. A very common mistake is to use these criteria for **model selection** which is simply picking the model with the lowest WAIC score and throwing the rest away. However, you should never do this. By discarding the other models, you lose the vital information contained in the differences between their scores. Just as the width of a posterior distribution tells us how confident we should be about a parameter, the relative differences in WAIC scores tell us how confident we should be about our models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, we must never let these criteria be the sole arbiters of our analysis because maximizing predictive accuracy is not the same thing as inferring causation. A model can be a \"**causal salad**,\" which is a term we've used in the past to describe a messy mix of confounded variables, and still make excellent short-term predictions. Such a model might help you forecast what will happen if things stay the same, but it will fail to tell you what would happen if you actually intervened in the system. We must be clear about our goals and statistics is no substitute for a coherent causal model.\n",

We are not just looking for a winner; we are using these tools to measure the overfitting tendency of our models and to tune them more effectively. In the examples that follow, we will distinguish between models that predict well and models that explain well, while also learning how to inspect individual data points to reveal exactly where our models are missing the mark."

        "We must remain vigilant about a lesson we’ve encountered before: Inferring a cause and making a prediction are two entirely different tasks. Cross-validation and WAIC are specialized tools designed to find models that make good predictions, but they do absolutely nothing to solve the problem of causal inference. In fact, if you select a model based solely on its predictive accuracy, you are almost inviting confounding variables into your analysis. This happens because \"backdoor paths,\" statistical associations that don't represent a direct cause, still provide valid information about the data. As long as you don't intervene in the system and the future remains like the past, these confounded models will forecast quite well.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, our definition of knowing a cause is being able to predict the consequences of an intervention. A high score in PSIS or WAIC is no guarantee that you have a good causal model. Consider the plant growth example in the last chapter where we looked at the effect of a treatment on fungus, which then affected growth. If we compare a model that includes the fungus (`m_6_7`) against one that omits it (`m_6_8`), the model with the fungus will almost certainly have a better WAIC score. It makes better predictions because knowing whether a plant has fungus tells you a lot about its height.\n",
        "\n",
        "But as we learned, the model that includes the fungus is causally \"broken\" because it masks the very treatment effect we are trying to study. To correctly infer the causal influence of the treatment, we must use the model that omits the fungus, even though it has a \"worse\" predictive score. A good score tells you that a model is a good tool for forecasting, but it doesn't tell you that the model understands how the world actually works. We cannot simply toss variables into a \"causal salad\" and expect WAIC to pick out the healthy ingredients for us."

We know the treatment works because we simulated the data, but because fungus is the \"pipe\" through which the treatment acts, the fungus is more directly correlated with the outcome. Therefore, a model using fungus predicts better and WAIC correctly identifies this.

While the treatment is effective, it isn't a 100% guarantee, so knowing the treatment is no substitute for knowing the actual fungus state if your only goal is a good guess. Interestingly, when we compare the treatment-only model (`m_6_8`) to a model with nothing but an intercept (`m_6_6`), WAIC finds them surprisingly similar, with only a 3-unit difference. This serves as a reminder that a \"causally correct\" variable might only provide a small boost in predictive power, depending on the noise in the system."

Therefore by removing it, we reduce the model's complexity without losing meaningful information which improves its expected performance on new data. The difference between these top two models is tiny, only 1.8 units of deviance with a standard error of 0.9, indicating that their predictions are essentially interchangeable. This is the classic signature of a predictor that adds noise rather than signal.\n",

        "Second, the appearance of a warning regarding high **Pareto  values** ( $ > 0.5$ or $1$) indicates that the PSIS approximation has become unreliable for certain data points. These high values usually flag **influential outliers** which are observations that are so unlikely according to the model that they exert a massive pull on the parameter estimates. Because a new, independent sample is unlikely to contain these exact same outliers, relying on a model influenced by them can lead to much worse out-of-sample predictions than the criteria suggest. While WAIC lacks the automatic warning system of PSIS, it is equally vulnerable to these influential points. In WAIC, this risk is reflected in a high overfitting penalty ($p_{WAIC}$) for those specific observations."

In this analysis, Idaho (ID) stands out in the upper-right corner as a severe outlier. As we saw in Chapter 5, Idaho has a divorce rate that is unusually low for its age at marriage, making it highly influential. Its Pareto $k$ value is over 1.0, which is double the threshold where the variance of the importance weights becomes infinite,and its WAIC penalty is over 2.0.

Because the Student-$t$ distribution expects extreme values to happen occasionally, a single point like Idaho won't exert such a massive influence on the other parameters.

While ideal, this method is extremely computationally expensive as a dataset with 1,000 observations will net you 1,000 separate posterior distributions.
